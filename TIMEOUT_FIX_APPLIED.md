# ‚úÖ Timeout Issue - Fix Applied

## üîç Problem Identified

Based on diagnostic tests, your timeout issues were caused by:

1. **Sleeping connections for 1212+ seconds (20 minutes)**
   - Database sessions were NOT being closed properly
   - Connections stayed in "Sleep" state forever

2. **30 background threads** holding connections
   - Advanced Data Collector scheduler
   - Health Monitor threads
   - No session cleanup after completion

3. **Connection pool exhaustion**
   - Pool size: 20 connections
   - Over time, all connections get stuck sleeping
   - New requests can't get connections ‚Üí TIMEOUT

## ‚úÖ Fixes Applied

### Fix 1: Database Pool Configuration (`app.py`)

**Changed:**
```python
# Before:
'pool_size': 10
'pool_recycle': 3600  # 1 hour
'max_overflow': 20

# After:
'pool_size': 20  # Doubled capacity
'pool_recycle': 600  # 10 minutes (aggressive recycling)
'max_overflow': 10  # Reduced overflow
'pool_reset_on_return': 'rollback'  # Force cleanup
```

**Why:** 
- Connections now recycle every 10 minutes instead of 1 hour
- Forces rollback on return to prevent stale sessions
- Increased base pool size

---

### Fix 2: Global Session Cleanup (`app.py`)

**Added:**
```python
@app.teardown_appcontext
def shutdown_session(exception=None):
    """Remove database session at end of each request/context"""
    db.session.remove()

@app.teardown_request
def teardown_request(exception=None):
    """Cleanup after each request"""
    if exception:
        db.session.rollback()
    db.session.remove()
```

**Why:**
- Ensures EVERY request cleans up its session
- Prevents web requests from leaking connections
- Handles both normal and error cases

---

### Fix 3: Advanced Data Collector Cleanup (`utils/advanced_data_collector.py`)

**Added:**
```python
def run_collector(self, collector_id: int):
    with current_app.app_context():
        try:
            # ... collector logic ...
        finally:
            # CRITICAL: Always cleanup session
            db.session.remove()
```

**Why:**
- Background threads were the MAIN culprit
- Each collector run was holding a connection forever
- Now properly releases connections after each run

---

### Fix 4: Health Monitor Cleanup (`utils/health_monitor.py`)

**Added:**
```python
def check_database_health(self):
    try:
        # ... health check logic ...
    finally:
        db.session.remove()

def check_application_health(self):
    try:
        # ... health check logic ...
    finally:
        db.session.remove()
```

**Why:**
- Health checks run in background thread
- Were holding connections open
- Now releases after each check

---

## üöÄ Next Steps

### 1. Restart Your Application

**IMPORTANT:** You MUST restart for fixes to take effect

```bash
# Stop your current application
# Then restart it

# If using systemd:
sudo systemctl restart banku

# If running manually:
# Kill the process and start again
```

### 2. Verify the Fix Works

**Run this immediately after restart:**
```bash
python quick_timeout_check.py
```

**Expected output:**
```
Pool Usage: 0-20% üü¢
Sleeping Connections: Should show < 60s (not 1212s!)
```

**Run again after 30 minutes:**
```bash
python quick_timeout_check.py
```

**Should still show:**
```
Pool Usage: < 50% üü¢
Sleeping Connections: < 600s (10 minutes max due to pool_recycle)
```

### 3. Monitor for 1-2 Hours

```bash
# Monitor continuously
python diagnose_timeout_issue.py --mode monitor --duration 3600 --interval 120
```

This will track pool usage for 1 hour. You should see:
- Pool usage stays below 50%
- No connections sleeping over 600 seconds
- No increasing trend in connections

## üìä What Success Looks Like

### Before Fix:
```
Pool Usage: Starts 0% ‚Üí Increases to 80%+ ‚Üí TIMEOUT
Sleeping Connections: 1212+ seconds
Trend: Steadily increasing ‚Üí System crashes
```

### After Fix:
```
Pool Usage: Stays 10-40% consistently
Sleeping Connections: < 600 seconds (recycled)
Trend: Stable ‚Üí No timeouts!
```

## üîç Verification Checklist

- [ ] Application restarted
- [ ] Quick check shows healthy pool (<20% usage)
- [ ] Sleeping connections < 60 seconds
- [ ] After 30 min: Pool still <50%
- [ ] After 1 hour: Pool still <50%
- [ ] No timeout errors from users
- [ ] Sleeping connections stay < 600s

---

## üìù Technical Summary

**Root Cause:** 
Background threads (data collector, health monitor) were creating database sessions but never calling `db.session.remove()`, causing connections to stay in "Sleep" state forever until pool exhausted.

**Solution:**
1. Added `finally` blocks to ALWAYS cleanup sessions
2. Added global teardown handlers for web requests
3. Increased pool recycling frequency (600s instead of 3600s)
4. Added `pool_reset_on_return` to force cleanup

**Result:**
Connections are now properly released and recycled, preventing pool exhaustion and timeouts.

## üÜò If Problems Persist

If you still see timeouts after applying these fixes:

1. **Check the sleeping connection time:**
   ```bash
   python quick_timeout_check.py
   ```
   If still showing 1000+ seconds ‚Üí app didn't restart properly

2. **Check pool usage trend:**
   ```bash
   python diagnose_timeout_issue.py --mode monitor --duration 600
   ```
   If pool usage still increasing ‚Üí there's another leak source

3. **Send me the diagnostic data:**
   - Output from quick_timeout_check.py
   - The JSON file from monitoring
   - Any new error messages

---

## üéØ Expected Improvement

**Before:** App works for 30-60 minutes, then timeouts start

**After:** App runs indefinitely without timeouts

The fix addresses the ROOT CAUSE (session leaks from background threads) not just the symptoms!
